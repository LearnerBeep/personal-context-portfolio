# Personal Context Portfolio

Every AI agent, tool, and system you use needs to know who you are. Right now, you re-explain yourself from scratch every time — your role, your projects, your preferences, your constraints. It's the most repetitive, highest-friction part of working with AI, and it gets exponentially worse as the number of agents in your life grows from one to ten to fifty.

The personal context portfolio fixes this. It's a structured set of markdown files that together represent you as a context package — something any agent, any tool, any AI system can ingest and immediately understand who it's working with.

It's not a resume. It's not a profile. It's an operating manual for any AI that works for you.

## What's In It

Ten files, each covering a different dimension of who you are and how you work:

| File | What It Captures |
|------|-----------------|
| `identity.md` | Who you are in one page — the file an agent reads if it can only read one |
| `role-and-responsibilities.md` | What your weeks actually look like, not what your job description says |
| `current-projects.md` | Active workstreams, status, priority, what done looks like |
| `team-and-relationships.md` | Key people, how you interact, what they need from you |
| `tools-and-systems.md` | Your stack, your setup, what connects to what |
| `communication-style.md` | How you write, how you want things written for you |
| `goals-and-priorities.md` | What you're optimizing for and what you're deliberately ignoring |
| `preferences-and-constraints.md` | Hard rules, strong opinions, things any agent should respect |
| `domain-knowledge.md` | What you know that a general-purpose AI doesn't |
| `decision-log.md` | How you make decisions, with real examples |

## Design Principles

**Markdown-first.** Every AI system on earth can read markdown. It's the universal interchange format for context. Not JSON, not PDFs, not databases. Markdown files that are human-readable AND machine-readable.

**Modular, not monolithic.** Not one giant "about me" file. Separate files for separate domains. An agent prepping your meetings doesn't need your full life story — it needs your calendar context, team roster, and meeting preferences. Modularity lets agents grab what's relevant.

**Living, not static.** This isn't a thing you write once. It's a thing you maintain — or better, that your agents help you maintain. Your projects file updates as projects change. Your priorities file shifts quarterly. The portfolio evolves with you.

**Portable across everything.** Works with Claude, works with ChatGPT, works with OpenClaw agents, works with whatever comes next. No vendor lock-in. It's just files.

## Two Ways to Build Yours

**Use the web app.** A purpose-built interviewer agent walks you through the whole process. You answer questions, it drafts your files, you correct what it gets wrong, and you walk away with your complete portfolio. Run it from `/webapp/`.

**Do it yourself.** Fork this repo and use the templates in `/templates`. Each template includes the interview questions your AI build partner should ask you, plus the output structure for the finished file. Hand any template to Claude or ChatGPT and say "let's do this one."

## After You Build It

The portfolio is raw material. What makes it powerful is wiring it into the systems you actually use. The `/wiring` directory has guides for exposing your portfolio as an MCP resource, using it in Claude Projects, connecting it to OpenClaw agents, and more. That's the real work — and it's on you.

## Deploy and Run

### Option A — Static Site (GitHub Pages)

This repo now includes a GitHub Pages workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` and a Jekyll config (`_config.yml`).

1. Push changes to `main`.
2. In GitHub, enable **Pages** with **GitHub Actions** as the source.
3. The workflow builds and deploys a rendered HTML documentation site.

You can also deploy the same content to Netlify or Vercel as static files.

### Option B — Interviewer Web App

A browser-based interviewer app is available in `/webapp`.

- Open `/webapp/index.html` through any static server (for example, from repo root: `python3 -m http.server 8000`).
- Configure an OpenAI-compatible `Base URL`, `Model`, and `API Key`.
- Start the interview, chat through the protocol, save drafted files, and download a ZIP.

### Option C — MCP Resource Server

A minimal MCP stdio server is available at `/mcp/server.js` and exposes markdown files in this repo as MCP resources.

Run it with:

```bash
REPO_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/personal-context-portfolio
node \"$REPO_ROOT/mcp/server.js\" --root \"$REPO_ROOT\"
```

Then configure your MCP client to launch that command. The server supports `resources/list` and `resources/read` for markdown resources under the configured root.
